📊 Dataset
File: house/Housing.csv

Contains information about various factors influencing house prices, such as:

Number of bedrooms

Size of the property

Location attributes

And other real estate features

🧪 Features of the Project
Data loading and exploration using pandas

Handling missing values and basic data cleaning

Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

Model training using Linear Regression

Model evaluation using:

R² Score

Residual Plots

Train/test data split using train_test_split from scikit-learn

📈 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the files.

Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Open house_price.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells step by step to explore the data and train the model.

📌 Future Improvements
Include more complex regression models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
